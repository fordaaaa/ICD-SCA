figure out how to use the old code
    
    probably keep all the functions but make new ones that are connected with the widget, so alot of copy and pasting for the main part of the function


make uis with figma/whatever like canva

    slot machine ui
    numbers uis for the slot
    figure out how to make a animation, or end up doing a slideshow type roll for the slot machine
